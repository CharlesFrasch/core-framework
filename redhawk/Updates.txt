New Feature list
January/February/March/April 2015
- Connection Manager
- createApplication call on DomainManager object (do not have to install application and call create on ApplicationFactory object)
- Event Channel Manager
- Stream-based input support for BulkIO (C++ only)
- Struct properties can have optional members
- Struct properties can have sequence members
- New property type "property" (deprecates "execparam" and "configure" types, although they're still supported)
- C++ helper (redhawk::PropertyMap) for accessing CF::Properties
- DomainManager and Application pointers as Component members
- DomainManager and DeviceManager pointers as Device/Service members
- Allocated NIC provided as member of Component class
- Component and Waveform namespaces
- IDM_Channel event notifying of the death of a Component
- ODM_Channel event notifying start/stop of an Application
- eventl utility that lists all event channels managed by the EventChannel service
- rmeventall utility that destroys all event channels managed by the EventChannel service
- New executeLinked call on the ExecutableDevice allows for the deployment of Components with colliding softpkg dependencies
- C++ GPP replaces the Python GPP. Capacity reservation does not require the explicit declaration on the Component's SPD
- Softpkg dependency wizard and code generators
- Graphical usesdevice support in waveforms for FrontEnd devices
- Port monitoring statistics are reflected graphically in waveform / node diagrams
- Improved wizards / graphics for findby's in the waveform diagram
- Added menu to interact with component logging at runtime
- Added shortcut icons to the hover-pad that appears when hovering over items in a diagram
- Added ability to expand/collapse components in a waveform diagram to simplify the diagram
- Waveform and node digrams highlight potential ports when making connections

May 2015
- Device Manager and Domain Manager properties are available through the Python interface
- Support for complex char types in the Java any utils
- __version__ added to the Python package
- Tilde is supported to reference the home directory when launching from the sandbox
- File refresh on Component load checks subdirectories in the loaded package to see if they need to be refreshed
- Execute bit is maintained on a Component package load
- BurstIO output succeeds with oversized push
- Eclipse updates, including the PyDev editor
- Improved help tooltips for FrontEnd allocation wizard
- C++ code completion / editor support when referencing REDHAWK shared libraries
- Improve port highlighting in waveform/node diagrams whem making connections
- UI support for new property 'kind' when editing PRF
- Ports have been give their own tab in the SPD editor; allows editing the new description field

June 2015
- GPP performs affinity (NUMA balancing) on the deployed waveform
- Comments added to assist in Doxygen generation
- Preprocessor directives added to limit the scope of visible items on code content assist
